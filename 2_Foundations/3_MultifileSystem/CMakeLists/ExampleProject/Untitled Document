# How to Build a large Project using CMakeLists

A typical CMake project will have a build directory in the same place as the top-level CMakeLists.txt. Make a build directory in the /home/workspace/cmake_example folder:

## Build Process
```
cd ....../ExampleProject
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## Run Process
If everything has worked correctly, you should now be able to run your executable from the build folder:
```
cd ......./ExampleProject/build
./<your_executable_name>

```
This executable should print the output on terminal.
If you don't remember your executable name then, go to CMakeLists file and check the first argument in add_executable. This first argument is the executable name. `add_executable(your_executable_name  path_to_file_1  path_to_file_2 ...)`
